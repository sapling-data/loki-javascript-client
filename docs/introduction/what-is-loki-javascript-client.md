#### Client-side Loki? In modern JavaScript? With no jQuery?

## Description
Loki JavaScript Client is a library that exposes client-side APIs for Sapling Data's Loki platform for use in a local development environment or in scripts/server-side code.
## Rationale
This API is syntatically identical to the Loki jQuery library, making it possible to write code employing Loki services that can be run locally (either in the browser or in Node) or in a fully deployed app on the Loki platform.
